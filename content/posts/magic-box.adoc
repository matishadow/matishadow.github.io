== Make gifts for people
[quote, John Green]
____
Don’t make stuff because you want to make money — it will never make you enough money.
And don’t make stuff because you want to get famous — because you will never feel famous enough.
Make gifts for people — and work hard on making those gifts in the hope that those people will notice
and like the gifts.

Maybe they will notice how hard you worked, and maybe they won’t — and if they don’t notice,
I know it’s frustrating.
But, ultimately, that doesn't change anything —
because your responsibility is not to the people you’re making the gift for, but to the gift itself.

== Inspiration

https://store.arduino.cc/genuino-starter-kit[ARDUINO STARTER KIT] inspired me once more.
In https://matishadow-blog.gear.host/posts/hacking-buttons[Hacking buttons] blog post
I described how I followed the last project from the kit.
This time I've made my own twist on the original project.

I used `Knock Lock` project to base mine upon.
It consisted of two components: a `piezo`
footnote:[A piezo is an electronic device that generates a voltage when it's physically deformed by a vibration,
sound wave, or mechanicalstrain.
Similarly, when you put a voltage across a piezo, it vibrates and creates a tone.
Piezos can be used both to play tones and to detect tones.]
and a `servo motor`
footnote:[Device that can turn to a specified position.
Usually, they have a servo arm that can turn 180 degrees.].
The project used the servo to open and close a box as shown below.

To decide whether to lock or unlock the box Arduino used the piezo.
Arduino could _hear_ and count knocks on the piezo.
If the number of knocks equaled to specific number Arduino opened the box.
Since knocking seems fun but not secure I decided to create a more interesting solution.
