= Hacking buttons - part 2

In this post I will briefly write about two small projects I recently created.
Both made use of remote controllers and both ended as pretty small.
Considering the size, I thought I'd write about them in just one post.

== LED remote controller repair

Inspiration for the first one emerged out of necessity.
One day I decided to repair the LED strip remote controller.
The top cover, visible on the left, fell off and made it impossible to push any buttons.

In my first attempt I used glue to attach the top cover back on the remote controller.
Apparently I used too much of the glue because some buttons stopped working after some time.
I investigated the damage, and the glue somehow covered some button pads on the circuit board.
I've tried cleaning up the board but quickly gave up fearing I might break the board this way.

Let's salvage what I can and at least repair `ON` and `OFF` buttons.
To do that I've used two big tactile switches, one red and one blue.
This kind of switch has four legs and if pressed two side ones get connected.
In our case the blue button makes two green cables connected, and the red one makes red cables connected.
I soldered the two green cables to places where the old button pads connect to.
By doing that I pretty much extended the button pad to a different place.
Now clicking the big buttons equals to clicking the `ON` and `OFF` button pads.

== Smart Stand extension

Second project ended up a lot bigger than the first one.
It extends a project I've done for my beloved.

=== Existing project

_Smart Stand_ project consists of two things.
It uses a digital photo frame to display photos my beloved took.
The photos come from a Raspberry Pi Zero, which is connected via HDMI to the digital photo frame.
The Raspberry not only creates the slideshow using `feh` image viewer but it also downloads the images from a couple of services.
For now these services include Reddit, Instagram and GuruShots.
To download the images I created a Python script which Raspberry executes using `cron`.
I've made the script available in the repository
