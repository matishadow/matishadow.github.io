= Hacking buttons - part 2

In this post I will briefly write about two small projects I recently created.
Both made use of remote controllers and both ended as pretty small.
Considering the size, I thought I'd write about them in just one post.

== LED remote controller repair

Inspiration for the first one emerged out of necessity.
One day I decided to repair the LED strip remote controller.
The top cover, visible on the left, fell off and made it impossible to push any buttons.

In my first attempt I used glue to attach the top cover back on the remote controller.
Apparently I used too much of the glue because some buttons stopped working after some time.
I investigated the damage, and the glue somehow covered some button pads on the circuit board.
I've tried cleaning up the board but quickly gave up fearing I might break the board this way.
