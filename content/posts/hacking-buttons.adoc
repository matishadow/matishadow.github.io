= Hacking buttons
:imagesdir: /hacking-buttons

== Idea
You'd think when living far from the city centre and near the underground station,
there's plenty of parking space?
_Nothing_ could be further from the truth.

However, something is even more baffling.
Most of the street at which I live is closed by a road barrier
which could be opened using a remote control.
There's not point in using it though because past the barrier there're even fewer free parking spaces.

Since I do not care about it working, let's play with it using _Arduino_.

== Progress
The project is based on a project from https://store.arduino.cc/genuino-starter-kit[this kit]
- “15 HACKING BUTTONS create a master control for all your devices!”.

=== Remote control investigation

This is how back of the opened remote control looks like.
As you can see, there are no buttons here.

On the other side we can see the four buttons covered with some metal caps.
In order to connect Arduino to each button we need to remove these.

After removing the caps this is how the PCBfootnote:pcb[A printed circuit board (PCB) is a board made for connecting electronic components together.] looks like.

=== Soldering

First step is to mount the remote control PCBfootnote:disclaimer[] into the soldering arms.

Two wires are soldered to the first button.

And the other two to the second button of the remote control.

=== Assembling circuit

In order to control the remote control using Arduino I used something called an _optocoupler_.

==== Schematic of an optocoupler
image:optocoupler.png[]

It is an ICfootnote:ic[Integrated circuit. It is a component that holds large circuit in a tiny package.]
which allows controlling one circuit from a different one without any electrical connection between them.
It consists of an LEDfootnote:led[Light-Emitting Diode is a semiconductor device that produces light from electricity.]
and a phototransistorfootnote:[It is a type of photodetector capable of changing (or converting) light into either current or voltage.].
When the LEDfootnote:led[] is powered by Arduino, the light detector closes the internal switch.
The switch is connected to 4 and 5 pin (https://www.arduino.cc/documents/datasheets/Optocouplers.pdf[datasheet link]).
When the switch is closed, the two pins are connected.
The two pins being connected is equivalent to the button being pressed in our case.

I also needed a 220 Ω resistor to not destroy the LEDfootnote:led[] inside the optocoupler.

==== Arduino connected to the circuit

There are two buttons to control (two arms of the road barrier) so I duplicated what I already had.

==== Arduino and the remote control connected.

_9V battery_ is used to power the Arduino so it can be disconnected from the USB port.

=== Arduino source code

Code behind it is pretty straightforward.

In `setup` I set both of the pins connected to optocouplers to `OUTPUT` mode.
This mode allows the pins to provide current to the optocouplers.

In `loop` a random number is being chosen.
Depending on the parity, first or the second button is being pressed.

The `pressButton` function simulates pressing the button on the remote control.
Arduino sets pin voltage to _5V_ for 1000 ms (using `delay` function).
Then pin voltage is being set to _0V_ for a random duration (10 to 60 seconds).

Below there is source code which is also available on https://github.com/matishadow/arduino-starting-kit/blob/master/project-15-hacking-buttons/project-15-hacking-buttons.ino[my github here].

const int optoPin1 = 2;
const int optoPin2 = 12;

unsigned long seconds = 1000L;
unsigned long minutes = seconds * 60;
unsigned long hours = minutes * 60;

const int pressTime = 1000;

void setup(){
  pinMode(optoPin1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(optoPin2, OUTPUT);
}

void loop(){
  int randomNumber = random(10, 60);

  if (randomNumber % 2 == 0)
    pressButton(optoPin1, randomNumber);
  else
    pressButton(optoPin2, randomNumber);
}

void pressButton(int pinNumber, int randomNumber){
  digitalWrite(pinNumber, HIGH);
  delay(pressTime);
  digitalWrite(pinNumber, LOW);

  delay(randomNumber * seconds);
}
